# People Counter System

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/908a5e78-847a-4cb7-83d7-e78eaa178fde)

A simple computer vision-based system for counting people crossing a virtual line in real-time video streams.

## üìå Overview

This Python script uses **OpenCV** and **Haar cascades** to detect and track people's faces, counting entries and exits based on their movement relative to a configurable virtual line.

- **–ü–∞–≤–ª–æ–≤ –ê—Ä—Ç–µ–º**

## üîß Key Features

- **Real-time face detection** using Haar cascade classifier
- **Object tracking** with KCF tracker
- **Virtual line crossing detection** with configurable Y-position
- **Automatic logging** of events (entries/exits) with timestamps
- **Visual feedback** with bounding boxes and counter display
- **Data export** to CSV and visualization
